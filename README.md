## 🚀 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Upload Your Sales Data
```
Upload CSV file with: date, item, quantity, price
Example: 2024-01-15, Rice 1kg, 45, 45.00
```

### 2️⃣ Add Local Context (Optional)
```
"Diwali festival coming in 2 weeks"
"Heavy monsoon expected next month"
"Local wedding season starting"
```

### 3️⃣ Get AI Recommendations
```
✅ Stock 50% more Rice 1kg (festival demand)
✅ Reduce Oil 1L by 20% (slow sales)
✅ Increase Sweets Mix 500g by 75% (Diwali)
```

### 4️⃣ Ask Follow-Up Questions
```
Q: "What items are selling slowly?"
A: Oil 1L sales dropped 30% - consider reducing stock

Q: "Should I increase prices?"
A: Hold prices steady - demand is stable
```

## 🎬 Sample Questions You Can Ask

- "What should I stock more for the festival season?"
- "Which items are selling slowly?"
- "Should I increase my prices?"
- "Tell me about my Rice 1kg sales"
- "What should I reduce to save cash?"
